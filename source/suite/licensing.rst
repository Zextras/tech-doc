.. _trial_mode:

Trial Mode
==========

If no license is activated, Zextras Suite will run in Trial Mode. All
the features will be activated for a 30-day period, with some
limitations:

- You can restore data previously backed up only on the same Zimbra
  Infrastructure.

- The Backup module can restore data exported within 30 days from the
  current date;

This is affected by the timestamp of the export, NOT by the timestamp of
the items thereby contained: you will be able to import all items
regardless of their date as long as those have been exported less than
30 days ago.

.. _how_to_purchase_a_new_zextras_suite_license:

.. _zextras_suite_licensing_has_to_cover_the_whole_infrastructure:

Zextras Suite licensing has to cover the whole infrastructure
-------------------------------------------------------------

The number of licensed mailboxes acquired must be greater than or equal
to the total number of account mailboxes on your Zimbra Server.

.. _how_to_find_out_the_appropriate_number_of_mailboxes:

How to find out the appropriate number of mailboxes
---------------------------------------------------

If you have Zextras Suite installed on your Zimbra infrastructure simply
access the Zimbra Administration console, click on the 'Zextras Suite'
entry on the left and then on 'Core'. The number listed as 'Your
Mailboxes' in the 'License' section of the page is the minimum number of
mailboxes you need to license.

.. image:: /img/Zextras_licensing_1.png

If Zextras Suite is not yet installed on your Zimbra infrastructure, you
can run the following search in the Zimbra Administration Console: the
number of results is the minimum number of mailboxes you need to
license.

.. card:: Query to copy in Zimbra Administration Console

   ::

   (&(!(zimbraIsSystemAccount=*))(!(zimbraIsExternalVirtualAccount=*))(!(objectClass=zimbraCalendarResource))(objectClass=zimbraAccount)(zimbraMailDeliveryAddress=*))

   .. image:: /img/Zextras_licensing_2.png

If the result is higher than the display limits, you can run the
following LDAP search directly from the shell.

.. warning:: Since the actual query is quite long, be careful and
   copy it correctly!

.. code:: bash

   root@server01:~# su - zimbra
   zimbra@server01:~$ source ~/bin/zmshutil && zmsetvars
   zimbra@server01:~$ ldapsearch -x -D $zimbra_ldap_userdn -w $zimbra_ldap_password -H $ldap_master_url '(&(!(zimbraIsSystemAccount=*))(!(zimbraIsExternalVirtualAccount=*))(!(objectClass=zimbraCalendarResource))(objectClass=zimbraAccount)(zimbraMailDeliveryAddress=*))' zimbraMailDeliveryAddress | grep "numEntries"
   # extended LDIF
   #
   # LDAPv3
   # base <> (default) with scope subtree
   # filter: (&(objectClass=zimbraAccount)(!(zimbraIsSystemAccount=*))(!(zimbraIsExternalVirtualAccount=*))(!(objectClass=zimbraCalendarResource)))

   ....

   # search result
   search: 2

And take note of the numEntries value
