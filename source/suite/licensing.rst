\*\ **Team Pro** adds a number of features to Zextras Suite Pro:

* Group chats
* File sharing
* Screen sharing
* Video Server
* External meetings
* Corporate virtual Spaces
* Discussion Channels
* A native, mobile app for Android and iOS

.. _suite_trial_mode:

Trial Mode
----------

If no license is activated, Zextras Suite will run in Trial Mode. All
the features will be activated for a 30-day period, with some
limitations:

- You can restore data previously backed up only on the same Zimbra
  Infrastructure.

- The Backup module can restore data exported within 30 days from the
  current date;

This is affected by the timestamp of the export, NOT by the timestamp of
the items thereby contained: you will be able to import all items
regardless of their date as long as those have been exported less than
30 days ago.

.. _zextras-store:

The new Zextras Store
=====================

The new Zextras Store features an improved layout and purchase
workflow. The main page is the **Customer Corner**, divided into
`Orders` and `Profile`. The first one, depicted in
:numref:`figure_store`, displays the history of all orders, while the
profile contains data about the purchaser, including company
information, location, contacts, and so on.

.. _figure_store:

.. figure:: /img/store.png
   :scale: 50%

   The customer corner page

For each order, a number of important information is displayed: the
unique order ID, type and expiration date, status, and cost. The
status could be **COMPLETE**, **PENDING**, **RENEWED**.

Next to each order, a set of icons (see :numref:`figure_store_icons`)
allows to execute an action for the order.

.. _figure_store_icons:

.. figure:: /img/store-icons.png
   :scale: 90%

   Available buttons for each order: download receipt, view details,
   renew, and upgrade.

.. _purchase_new_license:

Purchase a New Zextras Suite License
====================================

You can buy Zextras Suite directly on our https://store.zextras.com/
website. Here you can configure your Zextras Suite license.

- Firstly you have to enter the total number of mailboxes on your Zimbra
  server (minimum is **10 mailboxes**)

- Then, add the Zextras Suite License Plan: Pro or Mobile

  - If you choose Pro plan, you can insert the number of mailboxes
    you want to license with Zextras Team Pro (minimum 10)

.. card::

   Important notes
   ^^^^^

   * All the purchased licenses are **Yearly** subscriptions and they are
     valid for 365 days since the purchase date and includes ongoing
     access to upgrades, updates and support.

   * The maximum number of mailboxes that can be purchased online
     is 2500. Orders exceeding 2500 mailboxes qualify for a custom
     quotation so, `contact the Sales Team
     <https://www.zextras.com/contact-us>`__.

   * If your current plan is *Perpetual*, a license plan that is no
     longer offered, you will still be able to renew its maintenance anyway.
     Please check section :ref:`extend_perpetual_license` below for directions.

When you have completed your choice, the overall cost of the licenses
is displayed and you can check the cost’s details. Pick the payment
method you prefer and then proceed with the purchase.

.. _plan-options:

Options to Modify a License Plan
================================

This section explains all the available options to make any changes to
an existing License Plan, which are :ref:`upgrade_plan`,
:ref:`change_plan`, :ref:`renew_plan`, or
:ref:`extend_perpetual_license`.

In all cases, in the remainder it is assumed that you are already
logged in to the **Customer Corner** of your Zextras account.

.. _upgrade_plan:

Upgrade a Zextras Suite License Plan
------------------------------------

To upgrade a License Plan means adding some mailboxes and possibly
extend the duration. To access the upgrade, Select from the *Orders*
tab the license you want to upgrade by clicking on the *Upgrade* icon.

Enter the **new total number** of mailboxes. For example, if you
already have 10 mailboxes and you want to add 5 more, you have to
insert **15**

Zextras store will automatically calculate and show you the cost of
the added mailboxes for the residual duration of your current
license. Pick the payment method you prefer and then proceed with the
purchase.

.. _change_plan:

Change a Zextras Suite License Plan
-----------------------------------

In order to change a License Plan, for example to replace *Zextras
Suite Mobile* with **Zextras Suite Pro** or add **Team Pro** to
*Zextras Suite Pro*, you need to fill the `Contact us form
<https://www.zextras.com/contact-us>`_.

.. _renew_plan:

Renew a Zextras Suite License Plan
----------------------------------

Renewing a license means to extend the duration of the current Plan
for a one year period. To access the Renewal, select from the *Orders*
tab the license you want to renew by clicking on the *Renew* icon.

In the duration box, select the new expiry date you want to apply.

Zextras Store will automatically calculate and show you the cost of the
extended Licence Plan. Pick the payment method you prefer and then
proceed with the purchase.

.. note:: You won’t have to wait the license’s expiry date. You can
   decide to extend it anytime; the system will deduct automatically
   the residual value of your previous license from the final price.

.. _extend_perpetual_license:

Add a Maintenance Service to a Perpetual License
------------------------------------------------

The Maintenance Service is **mandatory** for Perpetual Licenses
and it is **cumulative**.

Therefore, you need a valid (i.e., not-expired) Maintenance Service
subscription to access technical support or to install software
updates.

If your Maintenance Service subscription has already expired, you need
to pay the Maintenance Service fees for all the missing period,
starting from the expiring date. To add a Maintenance Service, Select
from the *Orders* tab the license by clicking on the *Upgrade* icon.

Tick the checkbox labelled :guilabel:`Add 1 more year of Maintenance
Service`; Zextras Store will automatically calculate and show you the
cost of the Maintenance Service.  Pick the payment method you prefer
and then proceed with the purchase.

.. _how_to_redeem_a_bid:

(example shown in :numref:`figure_redeem_bid`) for a customer. In such
a case, follow the steps listed as below from within the Customer's

Requirements
============

.. _zextras_suite_licensing_has_to_cover_the_whole_infrastructure:

Zextras Suite licensing has to cover the whole infrastructure
-------------------------------------------------------------

The number of licensed mailboxes acquired must be greater than or equal
to the total number of account mailboxes on your Zimbra Server.

.. _how_to_find_out_the_appropriate_number_of_mailboxes:

How to find out the appropriate number of mailboxes
---------------------------------------------------

If you have Zextras Suite installed on your Zimbra infrastructure simply
access the Zimbra Administration console, click on the 'Zextras Suite'
entry on the left and then on 'Core'. The number listed as 'Your
Mailboxes' in the 'License' section of the page is the minimum number of
mailboxes you need to license.

.. image:: /img/Zextras_licensing_1.png

If Zextras Suite is not yet installed on your Zimbra infrastructure, you
can run the following search in the Zimbra Administration Console: the
number of results is the minimum number of mailboxes you need to
license.

.. card:: Query to copy in Zimbra Administration Console

   ::

   (&(!(zimbraIsSystemAccount=*))(!(zimbraIsExternalVirtualAccount=*))(!(objectClass=zimbraCalendarResource))(objectClass=zimbraAccount)(zimbraMailDeliveryAddress=*))

   .. image:: /img/Zextras_licensing_2.png

If the result is higher than the display limits, you can run the
following LDAP search directly from the shell.

.. warning:: Since the actual query is quite long, be careful and
   copy it correctly!

.. code:: bash

   root@server01:~# su - zimbra
   zimbra@server01:~$ source ~/bin/zmshutil && zmsetvars
   zimbra@server01:~$ ldapsearch -x -D $zimbra_ldap_userdn -w $zimbra_ldap_password -H $ldap_master_url '(&(!(zimbraIsSystemAccount=*))(!(zimbraIsExternalVirtualAccount=*))(!(objectClass=zimbraCalendarResource))(objectClass=zimbraAccount)(zimbraMailDeliveryAddress=*))' zimbraMailDeliveryAddress | grep "numEntries"
   # extended LDIF
   #
   # LDAPv3
   # base <> (default) with scope subtree
   # filter: (&(objectClass=zimbraAccount)(!(zimbraIsSystemAccount=*))(!(zimbraIsExternalVirtualAccount=*))(!(objectClass=zimbraCalendarResource)))
   # requesting: dn

   ....

   # search result
   search: 2

And take note of the numEntries value

.. code:: bash
