Zimbra 9 Open Source Edition build by |zx|
==========================================

Everyday, |zx| builds Zimbra and |suite| towards Zimbra: since the
rise of our company, we have always written code that is integrated into
Zimbra. The deep knowledge of Zimbra gave us the confidence to take the
responsibility of building and maintaining a professional Zimbra 9 Open
Source Edition (**Zimbra 9 OSE**) based on Zimbra’s official
repositories: welcome to the Zimbra 9 Open Source build by |zx|.

   A message from Paolo Storti, CEO @ |zx|

   In the late ‘90s I’ve started to work as Linux System
   administrator.  Lately I’ve focused on providing Open Source email
   solutions: during this period, the struggle is real. Integrating
   and maintaining a multitude of heterogeneous components was an
   ongoing challenge, nights and days spent on finding the way to
   provide a suitable solution.

   Some years later Zimbra broke into the scene and this was
   definitely the turning point for me: I immediately fell in love
   with the chance to provide a solution maintained as a single
   project in which all the pieces fit perfectly together.

   As a communication systems fan and Open Source supporter, I’ve
   found in Zimbra everything I’ve always dreamt of. This is the
   reason why I’ve decided to give continuity to this project I
   strongly believe in, by making available the |zose| build by |zx|.

Zimbra 9 Open Source Edition by |zx|
=======================================

While the Zimbra 9 source code is publicly available, some of its
components are not. Hence, |zx| and its development teams decided to
build their own version of Zimbra 9 with the purpose to provide a
better integration of |suite| with Zimbra and improve the user
experience with unique features. Therefore, |zx| provides unofficial
builds of Synacor’s Zimbra 9 under the applicable `Zimbra Open Source
Licenses <https://www.zimbra.com/legal/licensing/>`_.

Builds of |zose| by |zx| can be downloaded for free from the `Zextras
dedicated page
