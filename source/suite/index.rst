 Welcome to |suite| Documentation!
********************************************

This is the documentation of |suite| edition. It is still mostly
empty, except for the :doc:`auth` and some placeholder text in
:doc:`general`.

What's different than other Zextras doc:

* Logo is different and it's not accompanied by the project name.

* Simple custom roles have been defined, to write :red:`red` and
  :green:`green` text - see :ref:`compatibility-list`.

* We used ``.. include::``\s in :doc:`general` to split a long file
  into smaller chunks. (under the hood feature)

* A sidebar and a figure have been added in :doc:`general`

* Text width has been raised to **1200px** from standard **800px**
