|mesh|
------

|mesh| is a security mechanism that secures communication of
registered applications. It is used by |product| to add fault
detection and dynamic routing between its components.

.. card::
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold sd-fs-5

   Run setup
   ^^^^^

   The configuration is automatically generated by

   .. code:: bash

      # service-discover setup $(hostname -i) --password=MY_SECURE_PASSWORD

   This command will:

   * find the hostname IP address (:command:`hostname -i`)

   * set the **cluster credential password** to
     ``MY_SECURE_PASSWORD``. It is used for setups, management, and to
     access the administration GUI. See section :ref:`mesh-gui` for
     more information.

     .. warning:: If this password is lost, it becomes necessary to
	start over the whole setup of |mesh|, therefore make sure to
	store the password in a safe place (like e.g., a password
	manager).
