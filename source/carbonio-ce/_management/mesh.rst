.. _mesh_install:

|mesh|
------

|mesh| is Zextras solution for service discovery and service mesh, a
mechanism that secures communication of registered applications,
implementing access control to on-premises or external resources with
a single solution, including the management of SSL encryption
certificates

|mesh| is used by |product| to add health checking/fault detection,
dynamic and secure routing between its components (excluding faulty
instances).  Moreover, it also works as an application level firewall
allowing the exchange of only the information necessary for the
functioning of |product| as it was designed.

The setup of |mesh| depends on the |product| infrastructure, if
a Single-Server or a Multi-Server.

.. _mesh_single_install:

Single-Server Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. card::

   Run setup
   ^^^^^

   The configuration is automatically generated by

   .. code:: bash

      # service-discover setup $(hostname -i) --password=MY_SECURE_PASSWORD
   .. hint:: Replace *MY_SECURE_PASSWORD* with a strong enough
      password.

   This command will:

   * find the hostname IP address (:command:`hostname -i`)

   * set the **cluster credential password** to
     ``MY_SECURE_PASSWORD``. It is used for setups, management, and to
     access the administration GUI. See section :ref:`mesh-gui` for
     more information.

     .. warning:: If this password is lost, it becomes necessary to
        start over the whole setup of |mesh|, therefore make sure to
        store the password in a safe place (like e.g., a password
        manager).

.. _mesh_multi_install:

Multi-Server Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Multi-Server setup is slight more complex. as it requires to run
commands on all the nodes.

.. card::

   Run setup
   ^^^^^

   The setup is the same as in :ref:`mesh_single_install`, except that
   the command **must be** run on the *Directory-Server* node.

   .. code:: console

      # service-discover setup $(hostname -i) --password=MY_SECURE_PASSWORD

.. card::

   Copy Credentials
   ^^^^^

   The outcome of the previous command is a GPG key that you need to
   copy to **all other nodes**.

   Assuming that you have nodes ``proxy``, ``mta``, ``store``, and
   ``logger`` (see the Multi-Server :ref:`example installation
   scenario <multiserver-installation>`, use the following commands,
   provided you use the correct hostname or IP address of the nodes.

   .. code:: console

      # scp /etc/zextras/service-discover/cluster-credentials.tar.gpg proxy:/etc/zextras/service-discover/cluster-credentials.tar.gpg

      # scp /etc/zextras/service-discover/cluster-credentials.tar.gpg mta:/etc/zextras/service-discover/cluster-credentials.tar.gpg

      # scp /etc/zextras/service-discover/cluster-credentials.tar.gpg store:/etc/zextras/service-discover/cluster-credentials.tar.gpg

      # scp /etc/zextras/service-discover/cluster-credentials.tar.gpg logger:/etc/zextras/service-discover/cluster-credentials.tar.gpg

.. card::

   Complete setup on all nodes
   ^^^^^

   Log in to each nodes and run the command, making sure to use the
   same password used in the first step.

   .. code:: console

      # service-discover setup $(hostname -i) --password=MY_SECURE_PASSWORD
