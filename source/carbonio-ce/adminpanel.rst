=========
|adminui|
=========

|adminui| is the component that allows access to the administration
functionalities of |carbonio| and is installed by default from
|product| 22.11.0 onwards. It is not available for previous versions,
but can be installed after upgrading to that version, see
:ref:`upgrade-22-11`.

Like for every other component, it can be reached using a
:ref:`supported browser <browser_compatibility>` and point it to
https://mail.example.com:6071/login, replacing `mail.example.com` with
your domain.

To access the |adminui|, the default user is
``zextras@carbonio.local``, whose password should be changed after the
first installation using the command shown in :ref:`Create System User
<create-admin-user>`.

|adminui| allows to manage the |product| domains, mailstores, accounts,
|cos|, and privacy settings. The overall organisation of the panel is
similar to the others components: a the *Top Bar* allows quick
creation of a new domain or COS, while navigation items are on the
left-hand side.


A dedicated *Administration Guide* featuring directions and advises to
carry out the most common tasks will be added soon.
