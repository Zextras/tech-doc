 Installation Scenarios
========================

This section currently features two installation scenarios: a
**Single-Server**, with all Roles installed on the same Node and a
**Five Nodes**, which is suitable for small infrastructure. The
*Single-Server* is suggested for an infrastructure that does not
feature all Roles or for demo and testing environments. The
*Single-Server* can be installed using a bash script included in the
Scenario's description.

More scenarios will be added in the future, to cover infrastructures
of different size.

If you plan to install and use the :ref:`role-vs-install`, you should
consider deploying the *5 Nodes* scenario, because the |vs| requires a
considerable amount of resources.
