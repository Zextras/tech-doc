Auth
----

In this module you can change your current password and add one
recovery address, that will be used for the password recovery.

To add a recovery address, you need to provide a valid e-mail address,
to which a validation code will be sent. You need to enter this code
before the recovery e-mail address is verified and can be used.

You can modify the recovery address at anytime:
:bdg-danger-line:`REMOVE` the current address, then follow the same
procedure described in the previous paragraph.
