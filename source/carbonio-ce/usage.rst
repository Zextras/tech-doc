===================================================

.. _fig_top_bar:

.. figure:: /img/carbonio/Searchbar.png

   The top bar of |product|, used to search for objects and to create
   new ones.

In |product|, the functionalities to create new objects (email,
contacts, calendar appointments and events, and so on) and to search
have been integrated into the top bar. For example, it is possible to
create a new calendar appointment while reading e-mails or search for
contacts when planning an event on calendar.

To do so, use |product|'s top bar, shown in
:numref:`fig_top_bar`. Click the blue |new| button to create a new
object in the module you are currently in (i.e., while in the
calendar, create a new appointment) or the
:octicon:`chevron-down;1em;sd-bg-primary sd-text-white` to create a
new object in another module.

The search works in a similar way: the white button on the right-hand
side of, which changes label depending on the
current module, can be used to search in the module the string
provided in the text box. Click the
:octicon:`chevron-down;1em;sd-bg-light sd-text-black` to search in a
different module. A more advanced search is available in the
:ref:`Advanced search module <search-mod>`.

.. _calendar-mod:

Calendar
========

The calendar module allows to keep track of the appointments, meetings,
and events you need to attend to and share them with your colleagues.

Beside using |new|, a new appointment can be created with a click of
the mouse on the desired date and time on the calendar. The only
difference is in the start (and end) date and time: by using the button,
they are set to the current date and time, by clicking the calendar
they are taken from the clicked date and time.

Shared Calendars
----------------

You can also search for calendars shared by your colleagues: click
*Shared Calendars* in the left-hand side columns, then the
:bdg-primary-line:`FIND SHARES` button. In the dialog that opens,
enter the (partial) name of the colleague, then assign a colour, and
finally click :bdg-primary:`ADD`.

The calendar will appear in the list of calendars, and all the
appointments are shown; toggle their visibility clicking the
:octicon:`tasklist;1em;sd-text-primary` checkbox.


.. _contacts-mod:

Contacts
========

In the Contacts module you can keep track of all the people with whom
you exchange e-mails and group them in address books. Existing address
books appear on the column on the right of the module's list.

You can create new contact by using the |new| button and selecting
`New Contact`; they will be stored under the `Contacts` section of the
Contacts module.

Addresses of people to whom you send an e-mail are automatically added
to the `Emailed Contacts`.

Deleted contacts land in the special `Trash` address book, which keeps
them until you manually empty it. To do so, right-click the address
book and select `Empty trash`.

A right-click on the address book allows to carry out a few action on
it and its content: edit, share, empty, or delete it. Moreover, new
address books can be created.

For each contact, icons allow to carry out different actions: delete,
move, or write an e-mail to the contact.

.. hint:: To move the contacts from one address book to another, you
   can also drag the contact and drop it on the destination address
   book.

If any colleague has shared an address book, you can click the
:bdg-primary-line:`FIND SHARES` button under `Shared Address Book` and
provide the e-mail address. You will see all the address books shared
by the user.

.. _search-mod:

Search
======

The Search module vastly improves the search capabilities of the
:ref:`quick search <global-search>` top bar. Click the
:bdg-primary-line:`ADVANCED FILTER` button to open a dialog that will
help you refine the search criteria on all your e-mails.

You can combine multiple search criteria, some of which are inclusive
or exclusive (i.e., you can search for e-mails with or without
attachments, that are flagged or not, and that are read or unread),
while other allow to provide values for almost any other property of
an e-mail, including  sender or recipient, subject or keywords, type of
attachment, and limit the search according to a period of time or to a
size interval.

Moreover, you can search on tags given to the e-mail and limit the
search to specific folders. When all criteria have been entered, click
:bdg-primary:`SEARCH` to start the search, while clicking
:bdg-primary-line:`RESET` will clear the dialog.

In the resulting list of result, click any e-mail to open it. To
further refine the search, click the blue bar above the list of
e-mails. The dialog will reopen, with the same criteria entered
before: here you can add more constraints or change some of them.
