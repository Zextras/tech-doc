Quick Search And Create New Objects Functionalities
===================================================

.. _fig_top_bar:

.. figure:: /img/carbonio/Searchbar.png

   The top bar of |product|, used to search for objects and to create
   new ones.

In |product|, the functionalities to create new objects (email,
contacts, calendar appointments and events, and so on) and to search
have been integrated into the top bar. For example, it is possible to
create a new calendar appointment while reading e-mails or search for
contacts when planning an event on calendar.

To do so, use |product|\ 's top bar, shown in :numref:`fig_top_bar`. Click
the blue :bdg-primary:`NEW` button to create a new object in the
module you are currently in (i.e., while in the calendar, create a new
appointment) or the :octicon:`chevron-down;1em;sd-bg-primary
sd-text-white` to create a new object in another module.

The search works in a similar way: the white button on the right-hand
side of :bdg-primary:`NEW`, which changes label depending on the
current module, can be used to search in the module the string
provided in the text box. Click the
:octicon:`chevron-down;1em;sd-bg-light sd-text-black` to search in a
different module. A more advanced search is available in the
:ref:`Advanced search module <search-mod>`.
