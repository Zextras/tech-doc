 Carbonio Management
=====================

In this section we introduce some important management tasks for
advanced |carbonio| features. Currently, the available topics are:

:ref:`mesh_install`, a service discover tool based on Consul, that
allows |product| modules to communicate with each other in a secure
way. We introduce the setup of |mesh| to access both local and remote,
external resources.

:ref:`logger_node_config` contains the setup needed on a dedicated
Logger Node within a Multi-Server installation.

:ref:`update_ssh_keys`, which allows to keep SSH keys updated across
the nodes of a Multi-Server installation.
