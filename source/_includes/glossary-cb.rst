   HSM   
      The **Hierarchical Storage Management** allows to move data
      between different stores according to policies defined by the
      Administrator.

   Primary Volume
      The **Primary store** is the main storage device of
      |product|. Here all data are placed when they arrive (e-mail
      messages) or are created (documents, contacts, and other items).
      It is usually a fast but expensive device, since its purpose is
      the everyday operations of |product| users.

   Secondary Volume
     The **Secondary Volume** is an additional storage device used by
     |product|. Its purpose is to store older items and data, which
     are seldomly accessed. It is a slow storage device

   Administrator
     An **Administrator** is any :term:`regular user` that can access
     the |adminui|. Depending on the permission they have, they can
     play different Roles and can carry out different activities, for
     example a Domain Administrator can manage all domain-related
     tasks, while a Global Administrator can effectively manage the
     whole |product| infrastructure.
