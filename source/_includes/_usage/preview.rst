*Carbonio Preview* allows to have a quick look at those files before
saving them on the local workstation or on |file|.

Supported files that can be previewed include PDFs, text documents,
spreadsheets and other office files, and images, but excluding the
**svg** format.

By clicking *once* the name of the file, an automatic preview in JPG
format will be opened, centred and scaled to the browser's window size.


On |file|, to open a file for editing, it is necessary to right-click
the file name, then selecting **Open Document** from the drop-down
menu.
