Contacts

.. card:: Options
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   You can define how to populate your Contacts and the behaviour of
   the autocomplete feature. New contacts can be added automatically,
   while the search for colleagues' address can use the :abbr:`GAL
   (Global Address List)` by default.

   Autocomplete can take advantage of the GAL and of shared contacts,
   while typing a ``,`` can be used as a shortcut to confirm the
   currently highlighted suggestion.
