.. card:: Displaying Messages
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   The options here control how the e-mails are displayed in the
   mailbox and how often to check for new emails (i.e., *polling
   interval*).

   Other options allow to configure how to set the `unsend time`, that
   is, the interval before an e-mail is actually sent, allowing to
   stop the send process, whether to visualise e-mails by message or
   conversation, and which is the default query over e-mails, that is,
   which e-mails are shown upon logging in. By default, the query is
   ``in:inbox``, meaning that all messages in the **Inbox** are
   displayed.

.. card:: Receiving Messages
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   These settings define the response to incoming
   e-mails. Notification e-mails can be sent to a third party and
   different types of desktop notification can be combined (pop-ups,
   flashing browser title, highlight of mail tab, play a
   sound). Notification can be restricted to e-mail landing in the
   inbox or in all folders (in case you defined Filters, see further
   on).

   Choose also where to store e-mails sent from yourself, whether to
   send automatic read receipts and if duplicate messages should be
   deleted.

.. card:: Signatures
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   Define signatures that can be appended to the e-mails that you
   write. Use the textarea to write a plain text or HTML (default)
   signature, assign a name to them and add to the library by clicking
   the :bdg-primary-line:`ADD SIGNATURE` button.

.. card:: Signatures Usage
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   If, besides your primary e-mail addresses, you have aliases or can
   access shared accounts, you can associate to each of them a
   different signature. Whenever you create, forward, or reply to an
   e-mail, the correct associated signature will be added, according
   to the e-mail that you choose.

.. card:: Filters
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   Filters determine how to move incoming or outgoing e-mails to
   folders within your inbox.

   In the list of active filters, click :bdg-primary-line:`CREATE` to
   define a filter and, in the dialog that appears, configure the
   condition(s) that need to be matched, the action applied, and give
   the Filter a name. Filters are applied in a top-down fashion, so in
   case of multiple active rules, choose whether to stop processing
   other following filters.

   When multiple rules are defined, only those among the **Active
   Filters** are used to process e-mails. Filters can be managed
   individually by selecting them and using the buttons
   :bdg-primary-line:`<< ADD` (activate an available filter),
   :bdg-danger-line:`REMOVE >>` (disable an active filter),
   :bdg-primary-line:`EDIT` (modify a Filter), :bdg-primary-line:`RUN`
   (execute a Filter), and :bdg-danger-line:`DELETE` (remove a
   filter).

.. card:: Trusted Addresses
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   Here you add e-mail addresses that will always be displayed.
