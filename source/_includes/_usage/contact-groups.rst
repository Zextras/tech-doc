Contact Groups
--------------

This page contains the list of contact groups created by the
user. When selecting a group, on the right-hand side of the page shows
its members and icons: to compose a mail to the member or copy the
e-mail address.

Buttons above the group name allow to send e-mail to all members, edit
the group members (i.e., add or remove them), or delete the group.

A group name can be used as a recipient of an e-mail: you write the
group name as To, CC, or BCC recipient, and it will be replaced by the
e-mail address of each member.

Contact groups can be created by adding either contacts stored in the
:ref:`Contacts module <contacts-comp>` or arbitrary addresses, even
belonging to other domains. after writing an e-mail address, remember
to click the :octicon:`plus` on the right-hand side of the address.
