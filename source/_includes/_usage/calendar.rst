The calendar component allows to keep track of the appointments, meetings,
and events you need to attend to and share them with your colleagues.

Beside using |new|, a new appointment can be created with a click of
the mouse on the desired date and time on the calendar. The only
difference is in the start (and end) date and time: by using the
button, they are set to the current date and time, by clicking the
calendar they are taken from the clicked date and time. Attendees,
whose presence is either mandatory or optional, can be added by
writing their e-mail address.

Additionally, :ref:`mail-tags` can be added to any calendar event.

Shared Calendars
----------------

You can also search for calendars shared by your colleagues: click
*Shared Calendars* in the left-hand side columns, then the
:bdg-primary-line:`FIND SHARES` button. In the dialog that opens,
enter the (partial) name of the colleague, then assign a colour, and
finally click :bdg-primary:`ADD`.

The calendar will appear in the list of calendars, and all the
appointments are shown; toggle their visibility clicking the
:octicon:`tasklist;1em;sd-text-primary` checkbox.
