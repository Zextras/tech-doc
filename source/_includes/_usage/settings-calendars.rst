   General setting for Calendar allow to customise how the calendar
   and its events are displayed, how invitations are managed, and how
   remainders behave.

   The calendar can be shown for the next Month, Day, Week, or Work

   week (usually Sunday or Monday).

   showing a popup or flashing the browser's bar.
