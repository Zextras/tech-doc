Using a :term:`Shared Account` has very few differences than using a
regular account. The most relevant are:

* the read/unread status of the e-mails. Whenever an unread
  e-mail is opened, its status changes to read (i.e., the e-mail will not be
  shown in bold fonts and the number of unread e-mails decreases by
  one unit), regardless of who opened the e-mail. In other words, it
  is not necessary that all users read that e-mail for it to be marked
  as read.

* Contacts management: The address book(s) of a user and the address
  book(s) of the shared account are kept separated. When you write an
  e-mail from your (personal) account to someone who is not in your
  address book, the recipient's e-mail address is automatically added
  to your address book's *Emailed contacts*.

  Similarly, if you write an e-mail from a shared account, the
  (unknown) recipient's e-mail address is added to the shared
  account's address book, with the bonus that this e-mail address will
  be immediately available to all users that have access to the shared
  account.
