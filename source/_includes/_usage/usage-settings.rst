The Settings module allows to customise both the appearance and the
behaviour of the modules. Configuration options are grouped in
categories: :ref:`settings-general`, :ref:`settings-mails`,
:ref:`settings-calendar`, and :ref:`settings-contacts`.

.. _settings-general:

General
-------

.. card:: Appearance
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   Choose the size of the fonts and whether the `Dark Mode` is enabled or not.
   
.. card:: Out Time Zone and Language
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   Select the language of the interface and the time zone used by
   |product|.  If you change the language, you will be asked to reload
   the interface.

.. card:: Out of Office Settings
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   These setting allow you to define the behaviour of |product| when
   e-mails are received within a time period during which you are not
   available. You can choose whether automatic replies are sent and to
   whom: you can also send a different message to people outside your
   organisation or decide to notify only your colleagues (i.e., people
   in your organisation).

   Define also the time period during which you will be away. By
   default, an appointment that matches the time period is created
   on your calendar.

.. card:: Application versions
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   Informative panel reporting the versions of |product|'s
   components.

.. card:: User's quota
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   Informative panel reporting how much of the assigned quota is used.

.. card:: Account
   :class-header: sd-font-weight-bold irisfont

   Click :bdg-primary:`LOGOUT` to exit the current session.

.. _settings-accounts:

Accounts
--------

In this section you can add and configure other *personas* to the
account, change some settings for the *sent messages*, and decide how
to save messages in shared accounts.

.. hint:: The primary persona can not be deleted.
