This section contains general advices about the most common tasks and
functionalities of the various |product| components. The following
components have dedicated sections featuring more information, howtos,
and best practices:

* :ref:`global-search`: search for any item or create a new one
* :ref:`file-preview` files without the need to save them in advance
* :ref:`mails-comp`, the core component of |product|
* :ref:`auth-user` or how to allow users to access |product|

  virtual rooms to communicate in real-time with users

  documents
* :ref:`tasks-comp`: define simple activities and reminders
* :ref:`search-comp` completes the `Quick Search` functionality
* :ref:`settings-comp` is the place where to customise all |product| options

All functionalities provided by |zx| |product| are available after
logging in to the mailbox; access to the mailbox only requires using a
:ref:`supported browser <browser_compatibility>` on any device,
provided it is connected to the Internet.

.. hint:: For a better use of the |product| features, it is recommended to
   use an up-to-date version of Firefox or Chrome browsers.

On Mobile devices, dedicated application can be used to access
specific functionalities of |product|.

Use the URL of your webmail to access the login page and provide your
credentials:

* Username: your e-mail address
* Password: the same password associated with your **username**

.. note:: We use the URL https://mail.example.com/ to denote our
   fictitious domain and mailbox. Whenever you find it, remember to
   replace it with the URL of your mailbox.

.. index:: password recovery

.. card:: Lost password, what to do?
   :class-card: sd-border-2 sd-rounded-2 sd-outline-danger

   In case you lose your password, there is a method to gain temporary
   access to the webmail, provided the Administrator has activated the
   functionality. On the login page, click the *Forget Password?* link
   and enter your username. You will then be asked whether you still
   have access to the configured recovery account: if so, click the
   :bdg-primary:`SEND RECOVERY CODE` button and in a few minutes you
   will receive a temporary token that allows you to access the
   webmail. If the recovery address is not correct, or if you found
   the password in the meantime, you can return to the login page.

   .. note:: This procedure works for at most **ten** times, so do not
      use it too much!
      
   This functionality does not yet allow you to supply a new password,
   but you can contact the Administrator once you access the webmail
   and ask the Administrator to change it for you: afterwards, you can
   :ref:`Change the password <auth_change_pass>` by yourself in the
   Settings module.
   
Once logged in, the user will be on the Home screen from which he can
access all the features of his mailbox.
