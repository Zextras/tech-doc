Access to the Web Interface
---------------------------

To access |carbonio|\'s Administration Console, point a
:ref:`supported browser <browser_compatibility>` to either of the URL
below.

Since |product| uses SSL to allow access to the Administration
Console, it is strongly suggested to install an SSL
certificate. Please refer to Section :ref:`install-SSL-cert` for
installation of the certificate.

* The **WebClient** (that is, the regular user access), as well as
  other client protocols such as IMAP or POP, is available at:
  https://mail.carbonio.local/
* The **AdminClient** (for Administration access) is available at:
  https://mail.carbonio.local:7071/carbonioAdmin
