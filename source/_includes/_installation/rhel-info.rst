.. note:: To install |product| version 24.12.0 using Ansible, the
   control node (see Section :ref:`ansible-setup`) and the |product|
   Nodes **must be** equipped with the same RHEL version, so either
   both RHEL 8 or both RHEL 9, to prevent issues with the platform
   specific's Ptyhon versions.
