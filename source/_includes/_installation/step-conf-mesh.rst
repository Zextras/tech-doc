|mesh| is required to allow communication between |product| and its
components. The configuration is automatically generated by command

.. code:: bash

   # service-discover setup $(hostname -i) --password=My_Mesh_Password£0!

.. hint:: Replace ``My_Mesh_Password£0!`` with a **robust** password of your choice.

This command will:

* find the hostname IP address (:command:`hostname -i`)

* set the **cluster credential password** to
  ``My_Mesh_Password£0!``, which is used for setups, management,
  and to access the administration GUI. See section :ref:`mesh-gui`
  for more information.

* store the setup in file
  :file:`/etc/zextras/service-discover/cluster-credentials.tar.gpg`

  .. warning:: Make sure to store the password in a safe place
     (like e.g., a password manager). In case the password is lost
     or the credential file becomes corrupted and unusable, you can
     :ref:`mesh-reset`.

Complete |mesh| and |product| setup by running

.. code:: console

   # pending-setups
