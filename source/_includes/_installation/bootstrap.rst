On **Ubuntu 20.04**, **Ubuntu 22.04**, and **RHEL 8**, execute

.. code:: console

   # carbonio-bootstrap

On **RHEL 9 only**, restart the node:


.. code:: console

   # reboot

The bootstrap command will execute a number of tasks and will set
up the node. At the end, you will be prompted with a menu and, if
you already configured all, you only need to click
:bdg-secondary:`y` for confirmation.
