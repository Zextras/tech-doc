Execute:

.. code:: console

   # carbonio-bootstrap

The bootstrap command will execute a number of tasks and will set
up the node. At the end, you will be prompted with a menu and, if
you already configured all, you only need to click
:bdg-secondary:`y` for confirmation.

On **RHEL 9 only**, restart the node to ensure that service management passes entirely to Systemd control:


.. code:: console

   # reboot
