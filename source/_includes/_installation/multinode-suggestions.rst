Before starting the installation, bear in mind to:

* Make sure each Node satisfies the :ref:`carbonio-requirements` and
  you have carried out all :ref:`preliminary` tasks.

* Always start with the installation of :ref:`role-mesh-install` Role

* When installing multiple Roles on a Node, the tasks listed in
  *Bootstrap Carbonio* and *Join Carbonio Mesh* steps can be made only
  once, after all packages of the Roles have been installed
