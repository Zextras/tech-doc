Before starting the installation, bear in mind to:

* Always start with the installation of :ref:`role-mesh-install` Roles

* When installing multiple Roles on a Node (for example Proxy and MTA
  like in ), the tasks listed in
  *Bootstrap Carbonio* and *Join Carbonio Mesh* steps can be made only
  once, after all packages of the Roles have been installed
