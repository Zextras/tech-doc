Distribution lists can be simply created by clicking the
:bdg-primary:`+` button to open a tabbed modal dialog in which to
configure it.

In the first tab you can give a name, an address, and a description to
the distribution list; in the second add *Members* by simply writing
the e-mail addresses in the test field.

.. hint:: E-mail addresses are auto-completed while typing.

In the third tab, advanced settings can be configured, including the
option to send notification to new members and the presence of the
distribution list in the GAL.

The last tab recaps the settings: now you can either go back to any of
the previous tabs and change some of the settings, or proceed to
create the distribution list.

Once a distribution list has been created, it can be further
configured by adding aliases, which work like e-mail accounts,
changing the description, notes, and members, and granting selected
users the permission to send e-mails to the distribution list.

Dynamic Mode
------------

Distribution list's *Dynamic Mode* allows the automatic management of
members. Indeed, each Dynamic Distribution List is identified by a
name and by a unique *Distribution List URL*, which is an LDAP query
that automatically populates the members of the Distribution List.

To create a Dynamic Distribution List, the procedure is similar to the
normal Distribution Lists: click the :bdg-primary:`+` button and
provide a **Displayed Name** name and **list Name**, then click the
**Dynamyc Mode** switch to access more options, including the
*Distribution List URL*, which is mandatory. You can also make the
list **Hidden from GAL** and add owners to the list, who can manage
the configuration of the list.

Advanced options, like subscription and unsubscription options are
available after the creation of the Dynamic Distribution List, when
editing it.
