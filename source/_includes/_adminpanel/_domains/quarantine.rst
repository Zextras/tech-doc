In this page appears the configuration of the special *quarantine*
e-mail account, which holds all the messages either marked as Spam or
containing viruses. The available setting is the duration of the
retention time, i.e., how long these messages are kept before being
deleted forever. The account, including all the e-mail messages it
contains, can be deleted and recreated by clicking the
:bdg-danger-line:`DELETE AND RE-CREATE` button. At the bottom of the
page the list of quarantined messages is shown. Being a system
account, to view the messages you can go to :menuselection:`Admin
Panel --> Domains --> Manage --> Accounts`, click the quarantine
account, then the :bdg-primary-line:`VIEW MAIL` button to see the
quarantined e-mails.
