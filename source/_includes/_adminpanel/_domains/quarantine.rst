In this page appears the configuration of the special *quarantine*
e-mail account, which holds all the messages either marked as Spam or
containing viruses.

The available setting is the duration of the retention time, i.e., how
long these messages are kept before being deleted forever. The
quarantine account, including all the e-mail messages it contains, can
be deleted and recreated by clicking the :bdg-danger-line:`DELETE AND
RE-CREATE` button. At the bottom of the page the list of quarantined
messages is shown. Being a system account, to view the messages you
can go to :menuselection:`Admin Panel --> Domains --> Manage -->
Accounts`, click the quarantine account, then the
:bdg-primary-line:`VIEW MAIL` button to see the quarantined e-mails.

When viewing a quarantined message, the Administrator can carry out a
few actions on it:

* View the original message, including the score and the reason why
  the e-mail was marked as spam

* Remove infected attachments from the e-mail and deliver the e-mail
  to the recipient

  .. note:: If the e-mail still has infected attachments, it will not
     be delivered.

* Download the message and share it with the recipient

* Delete the e-mail
