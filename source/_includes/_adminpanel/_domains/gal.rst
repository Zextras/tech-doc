A :abbr:`GAL (Global Address List)` is a special account (*"GALSync
Account"*) that contains all e-mail accounts configured on the server
and provides the ability to quickly search e-mail addresses, for
example when composing an email or adding participants to an event in
the Calendar. A GAL can be internal when configured on |product|,
external (when configured on the LDAP used by |product|, or both.  In
this page you see the email-address of the GALSync account, you can
change it from external to internal, or vice versa, or both. you can
also remove it, create it if missing, and change some of its options.

The GALSync account is updated regularly, according to the interval
specified in the **Settings** section of the page. Administrators can
force a resynchronisation of all GALs defined on a domain by clicking
the :bdg-primary-line:`RE-SYNC` button.
