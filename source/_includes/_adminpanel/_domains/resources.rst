A Resource is a generic object that can be assigned an e-mail address,
but, unlike other regular accounts, they do not need any signature, so
you can not specify one.

A Resource can be either of type **Meeting Room** or **Equipment**:
to reserve either of them, send an e-mail to the assigned e-mail
address.

A policy can be assigned to Resource, to determine how to react to the
booking request, either a manual or automatic acceptance or rejection.

Additional e-mail addresses can be added to the resource, for example
to notify the company's facility manager which meeting rooms are
reserved and which are free.
