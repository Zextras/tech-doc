|product| does not have any installer: whenever new versions are
released, the |zx| repositories are updated and packages are available
for installation along with the other system updates. Therefore, the
upgrade procedure is usually a very quick activity, carried out 
by means of a few commands to be executed on each **Node**, be it the
(single) Node in a Single-Server installation, or all the Nodes in a
Multi-Server installation.

The upgrade procedure is the same, regardless of the currently
installed version of |product|. The difference is that if you upgrade
from |prev|, you usually do not need to carry out any other task
manually, while if you upgrade from any *older version*, you will
probably need to run some tasks or commands before, during, or after
the upgrade procedure.

Before proceeding to the upgrade, if you upgrade from |prev|, please
read carefully section :ref:`upgrade-prev`; otherwise, please read
section :ref:`upgrade-older`.

Moreover, check Sections :ref:`ts-up-prev` and  :ref:`ts-up-older` to
check for possible issue that you may encounter during the upgrade.
