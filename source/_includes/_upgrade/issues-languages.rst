.. card:: IMAP folders with Cyrillic characters

   If you subscribe to an IMAP folder whose name contains Cyrillic
   characters, chances are that you fail, even if you already
   subscribed to that folder. The reason is a missing jar, that you
   need to :download:`/common/download/zm-charset-22.5.0.jar` and
   save in directory :file:`/opt/zextras/mailbox/jars/`.
