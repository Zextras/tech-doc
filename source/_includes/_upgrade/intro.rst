released, the |zx| repositories are updated and packages are available
for installation along with the other system updates. Therefore, the
upgrade procedure is usually a very quick activity, carried out 
by means of a few commands to be executed on each **Node**, be it the
(single) Node in a Single-Server installation, or all the Nodes in a
Multi-Server installation.

The upgrade procedure consists of a preliminary task, followed by the
proper upgrade, which is the same for each **Node**,

Depending on the packages upgraded, some manual step may be
required. Please read carefully section :ref:`upgrade-checklist`
**before starting the upgrade**, to see if you need to carry out some
additional task.

Moreover, incompatibilities may arise in case the upgrade includes
third-party software, which may lead to some additional manual steps
to be carried out. Section :ref:`upgrade-ts` below
contains information to prevent or fix these issues.
