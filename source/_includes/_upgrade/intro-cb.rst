|product| does not have any installer: whenever new versions are
released, the |zx| repositories are updated and packages are available
for installation along with the other system updates. Therefore, the
upgrade procedure is usually a very quick activity, carried out 
by means of a few commands to be executed on each **Node**.

The upgrade procedure varies, depending from the version currently
installed. If the version of your *current* |product| installation is
|prev|, please refer to section :ref:`upgrade-prev`; if you currently
install any older version, refer to section
:ref:`upgrade-older`. Regardless of the version currently installed,
the successful upgrade will always bring |product| **to the latest
version available**, currently |version|.

In some cases, incompatibilities may seldom arise in the
upgrade of third-party software, which may lead to some additional
manual steps to be carried out. This is true especially in the case of
upgrading from older versions, so please check Section
:ref:`ts-up-older` before starting the upgrade.
