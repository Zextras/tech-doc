commands there.

We can not provide any estimate on the time required by the upgrade,
because various factors may impact the duration, including the number
of Nodes, their load, the speed of network connection, and so on.

In some cases, incompatibilities may seldom arise in the upgrade of
third-party software, which may lead to some additional manual steps
to be carried out. This is true especially in the case of upgrading
from older versions, so please check Section :ref:`ts-up-older` under
:doc:`/troubleshooting/toc` before starting the upgrade.
