Monitoring is the process of observing and tracking the performance
and status of a system or an application over time. It involves
collecting and analysing data to identify potential issues, measure
performance metrics, and ensure that the system is functioning as
expected. Effective monitoring is critical for maintaining system
reliability, identifying and resolving issues quickly, and optimising
performance.

The purpose of this section is manifold:

* To provide a detailed guide on the installation and configuration of
  monitoring tools for |product|. By following the instructions
  outlined in the remainder, users can effectively monitor the
  performance and functionality of |product| to ensure its optimal
  operation.

* Give some information about the log files (where they can be found,
  what they are used for, and so on)

* Some command to manage MTA's queues

* Information about the software used by |product| to provide
  monitoring abilities

To operate properly, a |product| infrastructure requires different
services like: Directory Server, Consul Service Discover, Apache
Kafka, Prometheus, and PostgreSQL.
