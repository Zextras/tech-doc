Lost Password
=============

If the Administrator has enabled the option, you can see a link
underneath the credential's text-fields, that allows you to recover
the password.

.. note:: Before you can start the password recovery procedure, you
   need to ask the Administrator to set up a recovery account for you.

When you click the *forgot Password* link, you will be asked to enter
your current username, the e-mail account (for example,
``john.smith@example.com``), then click the :bdg-primary:`SUBMIT`
button. Next, you need to confirm your e-mail recovery address. A
temporary *validation code*, that expires in a few minutes, will be
sent to the recovery e-mail address. Copy it and insert it, then click
the :bdg-primary:`VALIDATE CODE` button.

If the code is validated, you can :bdg-primary-line:`CONTINUE WITH
YOUR SESSION`, access your mailbox and then add a new password in the
User Settings' Authentication module, where you can also change the
recovery address.
