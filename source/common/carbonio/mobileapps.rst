Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|carbonio| Mail mobile app connects to the server through an HTTPS
secure connection and |carbonio| responds with its certificate.  This
process (called SSL handshake) provides data integrity and data
privacy to the information transferred between the client and the
server, which is encrypted, provided that the SSL certificate is
**active and not expired**.

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Android devices manufacturers have strict default settings on which
apps can display notifications, sometimes causing the |carbonio| Mail
App not to be able to notify new messages.

To make sure that your device allows all required notifications, follow these steps:

#. Log out from the app

#. Access the deviceâ€™s Settings, then enter the **Apps &
   Notifications** menu

#. Select the |carbonio| Mail app from the list of all installed apps

#. Enter the **Notifications** section

#. Enable the notifications (first option on the top)

#. Enable the banner notification on the **Appointment** and **E-mail**
   subsections

#. Log back in

Notifications should now work!

.. warning:: For push notifications to work on the device, the
   |product| server must be able to communicate with the
   notifications.zextras.com service on port 443 (The exact URL to
   which notifications are sent is:
   https://notifications.zextras.com/firebase/ )
