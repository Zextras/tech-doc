|task| is the component that allows to create simple entries to keep
track of your activities. 

Each task can be created by clicking the |new| button and consists of
a title, the only mandatory part. Optionally, you can provide a
priority (Low, Medium, and high) a description, and a reminder.

Tasks are presented as a list, ordered by their creation date:
clicking a task will open it and show its details on the browser's
right-hand side, where also its creation date and description are
shown; for each task you can

* Toggle its completion status
* Edit all its details
* remove a task from the list. The removal is permanent, so a dialog
  will appear to confirm the action. 

The number of tasks that can be created is limited to *200*: when the
200th is about to be created or when the limit has already reached, a
dialog window will inform that no new task can be created. In these
cases it is therefore necessary to remove older tasks to create new
ones.

.. card:: Reminders

   Reminders can be added to alert of an approaching deadline. Once a
   date and time is set and the task saved, at the selected time a
   pop-up will show the details of the task, if you are in the |task|
   module; while if you are in any other module, a badge will be shown
   next to the Module in the primary bar (i.e. the leftmost
   column). The number in the badge shows how many tasks have reached
   or passed the deadline.

   Besides a fixed time, a reminder can be configured to be shown upon
   every login during the expiry day.

   In the list of tasks, the deadline is shown in :red:`red` if it
   already passed.
