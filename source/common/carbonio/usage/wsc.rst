The |wsc| Role, currently in :bdg-danger:`BETA` version, adds chat
functionalities and, in conjunction with the |vs|, video calls to
|product|.

.. _wsc-text:

Text features
-------------

|wsc| ships with all the functionalities of a textual chatting system.

You can create a new one-to-one or one-to-many chat by using the |new|
button on the top bar. In the dialog window, either start to type the
e-mail address of a colleague or tick the checkbox next to the list of
account, then the |create| button to start the chat. If you add more
than one address, you will create a one-to-many chat (also called
**Group**): you can provide a (mandatory) title as a name for the chat
and an optional topic. You also become a :term:`moderator` of the
group.

While chatting, you can send attachments, possibly with a caption, to
the other :term:`members <member>` of the chat. With the |pv|
installed, the attachments can be previewed before being
downloaded. In both cases, attachment can be sent from or saved to
|file|.

When you create a new chat or group for the first time, a list will
appear on the left-hand side. Creating new chats or groups will
populate the list, which will show the most recent chats or groups at
the top of the list. You can then filter the list if you search a
particular chat or group, while for every item it is shown whether
there is an ongoing meeting (a camera icon will replace the small
avatar icon), the chat or group is muted (a barred belle icon will
appear), of if you have written a draft message.

In both chats and groups there is a sidebar on the right-hand side,
which carries a number of information and allows to carry out some
actions.

.. grid:: 1 1 2 2
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item-card:: Chat Sidebar
      :columns: 6

      In a chat, the sidebar is split in two:

      * The *Info* box shows the e-mail of the two participants and
        the avatar of the other member

      * The (collapsible) *Action* box allows to mute notifications
        (visual notification, if active, will still be shown) or to
        clear the chat's history.

        .. note:: The deletion requires a confirmation, is
           irreversible and is personal, meaning that the other users
           will still be able to see it.
        
   .. grid-item-card:: Group Sidebar
      :columns: 6

      In a Group, the sidebar is divided into three parts:
      
      * The *Info* box shows the title and topic of the group, along
        with the number of members

      * The (collapsible) *Action* box allows to mute notifications
        (visual notification, if active, will still be shown), to
        clear the chat's history or to leave the group. 

        .. note:: The deletion requires a confirmation, is
           irreversible and is personal, meaning that the other users
           will still be able to see it.

        If you are a moderator, you can not leave the group but you
        have additional actions available: to *Edit details* of the
        group (title and topic), to add *new members* or *delete the
        group*

      * In the (collapsible) *Members* box shows the e-mail and
        avatars of the other participants. It is possible to search
        for members or open a direct chat with each of the members by
        clicking the icon. A crown icon shows the moderator of the
        group.

        If you are a moderator, you can promote other members to
        moderator.

        .. note:: If you are the only moderator, you **can not** leave
           the group.
