 Manual Upgrade
================

The manual upgrade procedures requires that you log in to each node of
your |product| infrastructure and execute some command, rebooting the
Node as soon as you have successfully completed the procedure. Because
you need to follow the output of the commands and make sure everything
proceeds flawlessly, this procedure is suggested only if you want to
have the control of all the steps.
