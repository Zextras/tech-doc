Advanced Administration Tasks
=============================

In this section we describe and outline a few advanced tasks,
providing quick directions to carry them out.

Role-based Access Control
-------------------------

|product| uses a delegation mechanism to allow the principal
administrator to assign roles and permission to other users with the
purpose of sharing with them the administration tasks and duties,
electing them as either **Global** or **Delegated** Administrator, who
have different privileges to configure and manage these features.

In the context of the management of Anti-Virus and Anti-Spam
functionalities, each Administrator, either Global or Delegated, can
access with the personal account and be able to control and manage
them, according to permissions granted.
