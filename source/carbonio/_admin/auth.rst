|auth|
============

|auth| is the |product| component that influences the process of
accessing a |product| instance from the Login Page onwards, including
the access modality. Depending on the authentication backends
configured, the access mask changes, to allow user to provide their
credentials using any of the backends. This also is reflected in the
:ref:`auth-user`.

|auth| allows to manage all the Authentication Strategies
(user/pwd, SAML, 2FA, MobilePwd, QrCode) and Service Authorizations
supported by |product|.

This section is divided in three main parts and organised as follows.
Immediately below, you can find the description of all supported
authentication methods; the next two sections are dedicated to
:ref:`administration tasks <auth_zxauth-admins>`, which require
privileged access and are mostly carried out from the CLI, and
:ref:`everyday’s task <auth-user>`, which can be carried out
from the Web GUI by both administrators and users.

..
   respectively. Finally, the :ref:`list of all CLI commands
   <auth_zxauth-cli>` is given as a reference, with link to each command.

.. _auth_supported_authentication_methods:

Supported Authentication Methods
================================

|auth| supports the following backends:

- Temporary Auth link

- Self service credentials management

  - Mobile password management

  - Application password

- SAML integration

- 2FA Authentication (using OTP token)

- Credential Management by CLI

      Self Service Credentials Management
      ^^^^^

      Self-service credential management allows every user to create new
      passwords and QR codes for third-parties—​for example team members,
      personal assistants—​accessing her/his email account and |Carbonio|
      Applications from mobile devices.

      QR Codes in particular can be used to access Mobile Apps, currently
      |team| and |file|.

      More information and step by step guidelines can be found in Section
      :ref:`auth-user`.

   .. grid-item-card::
      :columns: 12 12 6 4

      SAML
      ^^^^

      The Security Assertion Markup Language (**SAML**) is an XML-based open
      standard data format for exchanging authentication information. It
      enables web-based authentication and authorization scenarios including
      cross-domain Single Sign-On (SSO), which allows the use of the same
      credentials to access different applications.

      SAML implementation in |product| relies on an external IDentity
      Provider (IDP), to which a user identifies; the IDP then passes
      authorization credentials to a service providers (SP). SAML
      authentication is the process of verifying the user’s identity
      and credentials. In |product|, SAML requires little
      configuration, because an administrator can generate the SAML
      configuration by importing SAML metadata from the ISP.  Each
      domain can have a different SAML endpoint and both SDP and IDP
      SAML authentication is supported.

      These are the key concepts of SAML authentication:

      Service Provider
         (SP) is the entity providing the service.

      Identity Provider
         (IdP) is the entity providing the identities.

      SAML Request
         is generated by the Service Provider to "request" an authentication.

      SAML Response
         is generated by the Identity Provider and contains the assertion of
         the authenticated user.

      Moreover, the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) endpoint is a location to
      which the SSO tokens are sent, according to partner requirements.

      Directions on how to configure SAML and integrate other applications
      in |product| is described in Section :ref:`auth_set_up_saml`.

   .. grid-item-card::
      :columns: 12 12 6 4

      Two Factor Authentication
      ^^^^^

      Two Factor Authentication (usually spelled as **2FA**) adds a security
      layer to the login phase, making unwanted accesses less likely to take
      place. In |product|, this additional layer is given by an One Time
      Password (OTP), which can be read as a QR code on mobile devices.

      When 2FA is configured on a |product| domain, it is mandatory to have an
      OTP to be able to login: providing only username and password will fail.
      Moreover, the attribute ``zimbraAuthMech`` must be configured on the
      domain with for 2FA to work properly.

      2FA applies only to those protocols or apps supporting it, for example
      HTTP and HTTPS but not to IMAP and SMTP, and can be configured at either
      device, IP, or IP range level, by means of the ``trusted_device`` or
      ``trusted_ip`` parameter. When an IP or IP range is trusted, 2FA will be
      successful for any login originating from there, while the
      ``trusted_device`` requires that the same browser or app be used,
      otherwise it will fail: if a 2FA login is carried out on Chrome,
      accessing the same page with Firefox will require a new login.

      In order to use the OTP, a domain must be configured (see
      Section :ref:`auth_requirements`) by the site admin, while users
      can configure it from their :ref:`Auth settings
      <auth_zimlet-create-otp>`.

..
   .. seealso:: Community Article

      https://community.zextras.com/improve-the-security-using-zextras-2fa/

      This article showcases a few deployment scenarios of 2FA in Zextras
      and describes how Administrators can take advantage of such
      architecture.

.. _auth_zxauth-admins:

|auth| for Admins
=================

This section is dedicated to administrators and the activities they
can carry out to manage and maintain |auth|. Here administrators can
find the requirements for the various authentication methods, then the
installation instructions and finally the credential management.

.. _auth_requirements:

Requirements
------------

In order to enable the authentication strategies available in
|carbonio|, the following requirements need to be satisfied.

.. note:: It is not necessary to enable all of them, simply configure
   the one you need in your infrastructure.

.. grid:: 1 1 2 4
   :gutter: 1

   .. grid-item-card::
      :columns: 12 12 6 4

      QR Code Requirements
      ^^^^

      The QR Code Application Password feature requires the following
      properties to be set at domain level in order to be functional:

      -  ``zimbraPublicServiceHostname``

      -  ``zimbraPublicServicePort``

      -  ``zimbraPublicServiceProtocol``

      Should one or more of the properties be unset, a notification will be
      delivered to the Admin reporting the affected domains and their missing
      properties.

   .. grid-item-card::
      :columns: 12 12 6 4

      2FA Requirements
      ^^^^

      In order to properly have 2FA set up, the ``zimbraAuthMech`` attribute
      bust be configured at domain level::

        carbonio prov modifyDomain example.com zimbraAuthMech custom:zx

      To enable 2FA it is also necessary, **for all services**:

      - to define a ``trusted ip range``

      - to set the ``ip_can_change`` on ``true`` and ``2fa_policy`` to 1

      .. warning:: 2FA requires a specific zimbraAuthMech and this makes it
         not compatible with other mechanism such as ldap, ad or kerberos5

   .. grid-item-card::
      :columns: 12 12 6 4

      SAML Requirements
      ^^^^
      There is no special requirement to enable SAML, besides
      having a SAML IDP Provider.
      
.. _auth_set_up_saml:

Setting up SAML Configuration
-----------------------------

To integrate a SAML application into |product|, you need to configure the
SAML IDP (IDentity Provider) using the SAML SP data. In our
sample scenario, we want to add SAML authentication to our domain
**example.com**, accessible at **SP_URL**.

The SAML configuration is carried out at an IDP provider, then
imported in |product| using a dedicated command.

The most important configuration options are the following. You should
configure them on the SAML IDP side.

``sp.entityid``
   **https://SP_URL/zx/auth/samlMetadata?domain=example.com**

``sp.assertion_consumer_service.url``
   **https://SP_URL/zx/auth/saml**

``sp.nameidformat``
   **urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress**

In order to validate against |product|, make sure that the *Name of the
attribute that is used as* ``NameID`` is set to **mailPrimaryAddress**.

You can now integrate a SAML application in |product| in two ways, either
automatic or manual. The following sections describe each method in
detail.

.. _auth_import_saml_configuration_automatically:

Import SAML Configuration Automatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SAML IDP provides a URL from which to download the configuration;
assuming that this URL is
https://my-saml-provider.org/simplesaml/saml/idp/metadata.php, you can
import the configuration using the command:

.. code:: bash

   # carbonio auth saml import example.com URL  https://my-saml-provider.org/simplesaml/saml/idp/metadata.php

.. note:: The URL supplied by the SAML IDP for an unsecured connection
   may be slight different from the previous one, like in our example.

.. code:: bash

   # carbonio auth saml import example.com url https://localidp.local.loc/app/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/sso/saml/metadata allow_unsecure true

You are now DONE! You can see the :bdg-primary-line:`LOGIN SAML` button on the login page.

.. card::
   :width: 100%

   .. figure:: /img/auth/saml-login.png
      :align: center
              
      Login page with enabled SAML.

By clicking it, you will be redirect to the SAML IDP login page.

.. _auth_import_saml_configuration_manually:

Import SAML Configuration Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to manually edit the SAML configuration, you need to
follow this 4-step procedure. In a nutshell, you need to export the
default SAML settings, modify them, then save and import them back.

.. grid:: 1 1 1 2
   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card::
      :columns: 12 12 12 6

      Step 1. Export the default SAML settings
      ^^^^^

      In order to export the default SAML setting, use

      .. code:: bash

         # carbonio auth saml get example.com export_to /tmp/saml.json

   .. grid-item-card::
      :columns: 12 12 12 6

      Step 2. Modify :file:`/tmp/saml.json`
      ^^^^^

      Open the resulting file :file:`/tmp/saml.json` in any editor and modify
      the requested attributes:


      - ``entityid``

      - ``assertion_consumer_service.url``

      - ``nameidformat``

   .. grid-item-card::
      :columns: 12 12 12 6

      Step 3. Check modified  :file:`/tmp/saml.json`
      ^^^^^

      The :file:`/tmp/saml.json`` file should look similar to this
      one:

      .. dropdown:: Simple ``saml.json`` file
         :open:

         .. code:: json


            {

            }

      Values appearing in the above code excerpt are taken from the
      example in the previous section. Certificates must be valid,
      they are omitted for clarity.

   .. grid-item-card::
      :columns: 12 12 12 6

      Step 4. Save the changes
      ^^^^^^

      The final step is to save the changes made to the file and import
      it into |product| using the command:

      .. code:: bash

         # carbonio auth saml import example.com /tmp/saml.json

      .. hint:: It is also possible to view or edit single attributes
         by using the ``carbonio auth saml get`` and ``carbonio auth saml
         set`` command options.

.. _auth-saml-logout:

Configure SAML Logout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some SAML IDP provider require that also the logout procedure be
signed. In case you had already configured SAML, you can proceed in a
similar fashion as described in the :ref:`previous section
<auth_import_saml_configuration_manually>`: export the configuration,
modify it, then import it again.

Here we show how to add signed logout to the configuration used in the
previous section, by modifying the configuration file
:file:`saml.json` presented there.

.. note:: We also report below the configuration file presented in the
   previous section, modified according to the procedure described
   below and with the lines interested by the changes highlighted. The
   line numbers are those

First, you need to configure the SAML IDP logout service URL (line
**7**, :bgreen:`sp.single_logout_service.url`). We use :abbr:`Okta
(www.okta.com)` as example SAML IDP provider, so the URL will be
similar to https://mycompany.okta.com/app/test/app_id/slo/saml.

Then, configure also the service provider's certificate,
:bgreen:`sp.x509cert` (line **8**), which however should be already
present.

At this point, you should be done and you can import the modified
configuration file.

However, in case the SAMP IDP requires that also the requests be
signed, or in case to sign the requests for security reasons, please
follow these additional steps.

* Create a new X509 certificate and register it to the SAML IDP. You
  can use a command similar to the following one to create one with
  :command:`openssl`

  .. code-block:: console

     # openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365  \
     -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privateKey.key -out certificate.crt

* Add to the configuration file the certificate as
  :bgreen:`sp.x509cert` and the private key as :bgreen:`sp.privatekey`
  (lines **8** and **9** respectively)

* Enable the signature generation, that is, set
  :bgreen:`security.logoutrequest_signed` to ``true`` (line **30**)

* You can also optionally enable the signature for the login request,
  by setting :bgreen:`security.authnrequest_signed` ``to true`` (line
  **32**)

.. _temp_auth_link:

Temporary Auth Link
-------------------
   
A typical user-management task that an administrator needs to carry
out is to allow the first access to the company's infrastructure to a
new colleague or employee.

When 2FA is enabled on the mailstore, a new user can not login
immediately, therefore the solution is to provide a temporary link
(*auth link*) that allows the user to access and configure 2FA.

Administrators can generate a auth link easily from the
Administration GUI:

#. In the user's **General Information** section, in box called
   *Temporary link*, click the :bdg:`Create a temporary link` button

#. A URL link will be shown in an overlay window and can be copied by
   clicking on the accompanying button

#. The link can then be sent to the new user

#. The user must access the mailbox within 12 hours before the link
   expires


Corner Cases of 2FA
-------------------

2FA is a popular mechanism to allow users a secure login to an
infrastructure, based on a temporary token (usually in the form of a
QR code) besides the usual user/password combination.

There are however a few cases in which 2FA can not be used: consider
for example a domain or mailstore on which 2FA is enabled, but there
is an application that wants or needs to use the SMTP service: since
SMTP does not support 2FA, the application would not work.

To avoid situation like this, which may involve any service or
protocol not supporting 2FA (like, e.g., the above mentioned SMTP or
SOAP), on |product|, an Administrator can create suitable credentials
that can be used by the application to operate correctly.
