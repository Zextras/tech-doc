"The |product| architecture is mostly based on services that make nodes "

"**Active Replica** is the foundation of the |ha| mechanism described "

"The Replica part is in charge of encoding and transmitting all the "
"transactions of the account to an :ref:`event-streaming queue <role-es-"
"install>`.  Once processed by the Replica, the events are consumed by one"
" agent, or even by multiple agents, in the destination Mailstore.  "
"*Active* means that the destination Mailstores are **active Nodes**, "
"reducing the need for dedicated resources that store the passive node of "
"the clusters.  This also improves the overall performance of the "
"promotion stage, since the service is already up and running."
