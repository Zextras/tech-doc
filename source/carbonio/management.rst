:ref:`videoserver` is a WebRTC stream aggregator, used by the |team|
module to improve performances and scalability.

:ref:`backup-mod` introduces the architecture of |backup| and the
various alternatives to create backups of the data and metadata stored
in a |carbonio| installation.

:ref:`backup_restore-strategies` describes the methods available to
recover items, accounts, or whole domains.

:ref:`backup_advanced_techniques` presents how to use the backup in
