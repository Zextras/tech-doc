===============================
 Upgrade From |product| 24.5.0
===============================

This section guides you in the upgrade from |product| **24.5.0** to
the latest available version, |release|, which contains a number of
technical and performance improvements, bug fixes, and security fixes.

Depending on the |carbonio| and operating system starting versions,
you might need to carry out different tasks. Indeed, since the
**24.5.0** release, two major improvements have become available.

#. support for new operating systems: **Ubuntu 22.04** and **RHEL 9**
#. support for **PostgreSQL 16**

We encourage you to introduce both of them into your infrastructure,
although you can choose to upgrade only |product|.
