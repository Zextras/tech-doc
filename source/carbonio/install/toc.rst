=========

This section contains all information necessary to install |product|
within your infrastructure. Starting from the architecture, we
introduce then the requirements of |product| and the notion of
:term:`Role`. This Section finally describes the installation
scenarios: the basic installation on a Single-Server, followed by more
complex Multi-Node scenarios from 5 to 11 Nodes. All Scenarios can be
installed using Ansible.
