 Install
=========

This section contains all information necessary to install |product|
within your infrastructure. Starting from the architecture, we
introduce then the requirements of |product| and the notion of
:term:`Role`, followed by a list of available Roles and the
instructions to install that role on a Node.

The core of this section is the description of the installation
scenarios we envisioned and their deployment: the basic installation
on a Single-Server, followed by more complex Multi-Node scenarios from
5 to 14 Nodes. All scenarios provide an *inventory file* that can be
fed to an Ansible playbook for an automatically installation
