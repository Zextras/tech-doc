White Labelling
===============

|product| supports *White Labelling*, allowing therefore to quickly
customise many different parts of its web interface to resemble a
company's own corporate identity.

Currently, |product| supports white labelling of the following graphic
parts, that can be defined separately for the |adminui| and the End
User.

All the White Labelling options are available in the |adminui| under
:menuselection:`Domains --> Global --> Theme`.
