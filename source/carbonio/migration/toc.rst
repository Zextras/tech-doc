 Migration to |product|
========================

A *migration procedure* to |product| allows to import configurations
and data into a mail server infrastructure based on |product| from an
existent infrastructure, which is about to be decommissioned or
dismissed. This section contains several procedures to migrate to
|product|, depending on the system from which you want to migrate
away. Before attempting a migration, please read Section *Preliminares*.
